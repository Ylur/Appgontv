Yes, with the modifications and suggestions outlined previously, the four code files—`UserStorage.swift`, `AuthView.swift`, `AuthViewModel.swift`, and `SignUpView.swift`—will work together cohesively in a typical SwiftUI application using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. Here's a brief recap of how each component interacts within this architecture:

### UserStorage.swift
This class acts as the model component that directly manages the data related to user authentication. It handles user data storage, validation, and retrieval processes, such as:
- Checking if a username exists.
- Adding new users with hashed passwords and salts.
- Authenticating existing users.
- Ensuring sign-ups respect domain restrictions.

### AuthViewModel.swift
This ViewModel acts as the intermediary between the views (`AuthView` and `SignUpView`) and the model (`UserStorage`). It manages:
- Initiating user sign-in and sign-up processes.
- Updating observable properties that reflect the current authentication state (e.g., whether the user is signed in).
- Providing user feedback by setting error messages when authentication fails.

### AuthView.swift
This view is responsible for displaying the user interface where users can sign in. It interacts with `AuthViewModel` to:
- Bind user input fields for username and password.
- Trigger authentication processes on button actions.
- Display error messages or state changes communicated by the ViewModel.

### SignUpView.swift
This view handles the user interface for signing up new users. It utilizes `AuthViewModel` to:
- Capture new user credentials.
- Invoke the sign-up process when the user submits the form.
- Show any feedback or error messages related to the sign-up process.

### How They Work Together
- **Data Flow**: `UserStorage` provides the necessary data management functionalities. `AuthViewModel` interacts with this storage to perform operations based on user actions captured in `AuthView` and `SignUpView`.
- **State Management**: `AuthViewModel` maintains and updates the authentication state using `@Published` properties, which trigger UI updates in `AuthView` and `SignUpView` through SwiftUI's reactive data flow mechanisms.
- **Navigation and User Input**: Both `AuthView` and `SignUpView` communicate user inputs back to `AuthViewModel` via bindings and function calls. The ViewModel processes these inputs using logic defined in `UserStorage` and updates the views accordingly based on the outcomes.

### Example Interaction
1. **User Signs Up**: The user fills out their details in `SignUpView` and submits.
2. **ViewModel Processes**: `SignUpView` calls `signUp` on `AuthViewModel`, passing the user's details.
3. **Storage Validation**: `AuthViewModel` uses `UserStorage` to check the validity of the user's details (e.g., domain validation, existing user check) and attempts to add the new user.
4. **Feedback**: `AuthViewModel` updates its state based on the outcome (success or error), and `SignUpView` reflects these changes (e.g., showing an error message or redirecting the user).

This setup ensures that your application maintains a clean separation of concerns, enhances maintainability, and leverages SwiftUI's strong support for reactive programming paradigms.
